This is a very simple DQMGUI prototype, reading straight from EOS and rendering client-side using JSROOT. The TDirectory ROOT files are accessed using uproot, which is much easier (and seems to be faster?) than "real" root.

To run:

ssh $USER@lxplus.cern.ch -L 8086:localhost:8086
cmsrel CMSSW_11_0_0_pre6
cd CMSSW_11_0_0_pre6/src/
cmsenv
git cms-init
git cms-merge-topic schneiml:dqmgui-mini-prototype
cd DQMServices/Components/scripts/minigui/
python minigui.py

Then browse to http://localhost:8086/
