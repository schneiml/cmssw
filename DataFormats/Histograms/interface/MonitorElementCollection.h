/**\class MonitorElementCollection MonitorElementCollection.h "DataFormats/Histograms/interface/MonitorElementCollection.h"

 Description: Product to represent DQM data in LuminosityBlocks and Runs.
 The MonitorElements are represented by a simple struct that only contains the 
 required fields to represent a ME. The only opration allowed on these objects
 is merging, which is a important part of the DQM functionality and should be
 handled by EDM.
 Once a MonitorElement enters this product, it is immutable. During event
 processing, the ROOT objects need to be protectd by locks. These locks are not
 present in this structure: Any potential modification needs to be done as a
 copy-on-write and create a new MonitorElement.
 The file IO for these objects should still be handled by the DQMIO classes
 (DQMRootOutputModule and DQMRootSource), so persistent=false would be ok for
 this class. However, if we can get EDM IO cheaply, it could be useful to 
 handle corner cases like MEtoEDM more cleanly.

 Usage: This product should only be handled by the DQMStore, which provides 
 access to the MEs inside. The DQMStore will wrap the MonitorElementData in
 real MonitorElements, which allow various operations on the underlying 
 histograms, depending on the current stage of processing: In the RECO step,
 only filling is allowed, while in HARVESTING, the same data will be wrapped in
 a MonitorElement that also allows access to the ROOT objects.
 We only use pointers to MonitorElementData, to allow replacing it with a
 variable-size templated version later. That could eliminate one level of 
 indirection in accessing histograms.

    // [0] Merging should increase the statistics, but not change the number of
    // MEs, at least with the current workflows. It might be convenient to
    // allow it, but for the beginning, it would only mask errors.
    // [1] The DQM framework should guarantee same booking parameters as long
    // as we stay within the Scope of the MEs.
    // [2] To implement e.g. MEs covering blocks of 10LS, we'd store them in a
    // run product, but have as many MEs with same name but different range as
    // needed to perserve the wanted granularity. Merging then can merge or
    // concatenate as possible/needed.
    // Problem: We need to keep copies in memory until the end of run, even
    // though we could save them to the output file as soon as it is clear that
    // the nexe LS will not fall into the same block. Instead, we could drop
    // them into the next lumi block we see; the semantics would be weird (the
    // MEs in the lumi block don't actually correspond to the lumi block they
    // are in) but the DQMIO output should be able to handle that.
